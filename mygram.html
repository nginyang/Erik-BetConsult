            The concept of sustainability has been expanding to all areas of economic activity,<br>
             including construction engineering. Construction engineering is a complex discipline that involves designing, planning, constructing and managing infrastructures. In this Special Issue, 27 selected and peer-reviewed papers contribute to sustainable construction by offering technological, economic, social and environmental benefits through a variety of methodologies and tools, including fundamental decision-making models and methods as well as advanced multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods and techniques. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The papers are mainly concentrated in five areas: <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Visit cib.ok.gov/</a>Sustainable architecture; construction/reconstruction technology and sustainable construction materials; construction economics, including investments, supply, contracting and costs calculation; infrastructure planning and assessment; project risk perception, analysis and assessment, with an emphasis on sustainability
